        Returns a list of folders for the current account.<br>
        The method operates in two modes:<br>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Folder Tree Mode</b>: Activated if no filter parameters are provided. This mode returns the account's
        folders (spaces), their descendant folders, the root folder, and the recycle bin folder
        (note that "deleted" parameter can affect the result, see below).
        Filtering can be requested in this mode using the descendants=true parameter along with filter parameters.

        <li><b>Folders Mode</b>: Activated if the parameter descendant=false is specified or if there is at least
        one filter parameter, e.g., project=true. This mode returns only the account's folders filtered by the
        specified parameters.
        </ul>

        The chosen mode can be identified by the "kind" key in the result JSON body, with "kind": "folderTree"
        for Folder Tree Mode and "kind": "folders" for Folders Mode.

        Returns the list of folders from a specific folder in the current account. If the root or recycle bin
        folder id is specified, the method returns the list of folders of the root and recycle bin respectively.<br>
        The method operates in two modes:
        <ul>
        <li><b>Folder Tree Mode</b>: Activated if no filter parameters are provided. This mode returns the requested
        folders (spaces), their descendant folders, the root folder, and the recycle bin folder.

        <li><b>Folders Mode</b>: Activated if the parameter descendant=false is specified or if there is at least
        one filter parameter, e.g., project=true. This mode returns only the account's folders filtered by the
        specified parameters.
        </ul>

        The chosen mode can be identified by the "kind" key in the result JSON body, with "kind": "folderTree"
        for Folder Tree Mode and "kind": "folders" for Folders Mode.

      description: |-
        Returns the list of folders from a specific space in the current account.<br>
        The method operates in two modes:<br>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Folder Tree Mode</b>: Activated if no filter parameters are provided. This mode returns the required
        space, it's descendant folders, the root folder, and the recycle bin folder (note that "deleted" parameter
        can affect the result, see below).
        Filtering can be requested in this mode using the descendants=true parameter along with filter parameters.

        <li><b>Folders Mode</b>: Activated if the parameter descendant=false is specified or if there is at least
        one filter parameter, e.g., project=true. This mode returns only required space's folders filtered by the
        specified parameters.
        </ul>
        The chosen mode can be identified by the "kind" key in the result JSON body, with "kind": "folderTree"
        for Folder Tree Mode and "kind": "folders" for Folders Mode.
